## üìö Project Overview

This project explores and compares multiple machine learning and deep learning models for the Fashion MNIST image classification benchmark. The goal is to demonstrate the performance improvements from classical machine learning (Logistic Regression), through fully connected (dense) neural networks, to advanced Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) with automated hyperparameter tuning.

## üóÇÔ∏è Dataset

- **Fashion MNIST:** 70,000 grayscale images (28x28 pixels) of clothing items, split into 60,000 training and 10,000 test images.
- **Classes:** 10 categories (e.g., T-shirt/top, Trouser, Pullover, Dress, Coat, Sandal, Shirt, Sneaker, Bag, Ankle boot).
- **Download Source:** [Keras Datasets API](https://keras.io/api/datasets/fashion_mnist/) (loaded automatically in notebook).

## ‚öôÔ∏è Workflow

1. **Data Loading & Preprocessing**
    - Normalize pixel values to [0, 1].
    - Prepare images as flattened vectors (for classical ML & dense NN) and as 2D arrays with channel (for CNN).
    - One-hot encode labels for neural networks.
    - Visualize class distribution and sample images.

2. **Model 1: Logistic Regression (Baseline)**
    - Treats each image as a flat vector.
    - Provides a reference for advanced models.

3. **Model 2: Dense Neural Network**
    - Two hidden layers with ReLU activation.
    - Models non-linear relationships, but does not leverage image spatial structure.

4. **Model 3: Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)**
    - Two convolutional layers (with max pooling), followed by dense and dropout layers.
    - Learns spatial features (edges, textures, patterns) automatically.
    - Yields significant performance improvement.

5. **Hyperparameter Tuning (Keras Tuner)**
    - Automated random search for optimal Conv2D filters, kernel sizes, dense units, and dropout rate.
    - Trains the best-found CNN for final evaluation.

6. **Evaluation & Comparison**
    - Metrics: Test accuracy, confusion matrix, precision, recall, F1-score.
    - Visualizations: Bar plots, grouped classification reports, comparison tables.
